all events for the html elements in angular will be wrapped inside ()
example events
click , keyup

keyup event-->Listener which is registered on the html input element
input-->keyup-->binds to the function -->onKey($event)

Project-->Angular technology (HTML, CSS , JS)
Project-->1.)TodoApp , 2.)House Brokerage (Magic bricks)
